## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- Implemented PhotoUpload component with drag-and-drop + click-to-browse
- Shows preview with remove button when photo is uploaded
- Files changed: src/components/photo-upload.tsx (new), src/app/page.tsx (replaced scaffold)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Using `<img>` for data URLs is fine (next/image warning is expected)
  - Photo state lives in page.tsx, passed down as props
  - Card component used for upload zone styling
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
- Implemented AgeSelector component with shadcn Slider (1-12), default age 3
- Displays age, complexity label (Simple/Medium/Detailed), and description
- Age state lives in page.tsx alongside photo state
- Files changed: src/components/age-selector.tsx (new), src/app/page.tsx (added age state + component)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - getComplexityLabel helper maps age ranges to complexity — reuse in API route for prompt building
  - Slider onValueChange returns array, destructure first element
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-003
- Implemented POST /api/generate route with GPT-4o vision analysis + gpt-image-1 coloring page generation
- Complexity prompt varies by age (Simple/Medium/Detailed)
- Returns base64 PNG image + scene description
- Files changed: src/app/api/generate/route.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gpt-image-1 supports b64_json response format directly
  - Split base64 data URL to extract raw base64 for OpenAI vision API
  - getComplexityPrompt duplicates logic from age-selector — could extract to shared util if needed
