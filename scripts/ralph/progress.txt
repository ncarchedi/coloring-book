## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- Implemented PhotoUpload component with drag-and-drop + click-to-browse
- Shows preview with remove button when photo is uploaded
- Files changed: src/components/photo-upload.tsx (new), src/app/page.tsx (replaced scaffold)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Using `<img>` for data URLs is fine (next/image warning is expected)
  - Photo state lives in page.tsx, passed down as props
  - Card component used for upload zone styling
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
- Implemented AgeSelector component with shadcn Slider (1-12), default age 3
- Displays age, complexity label (Simple/Medium/Detailed), and description
- Age state lives in page.tsx alongside photo state
- Files changed: src/components/age-selector.tsx (new), src/app/page.tsx (added age state + component)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - getComplexityLabel helper maps age ranges to complexity — reuse in API route for prompt building
  - Slider onValueChange returns array, destructure first element
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-003
- Implemented POST /api/generate route with GPT-4o vision analysis + gpt-image-1 coloring page generation
- Complexity prompt varies by age (Simple/Medium/Detailed)
- Returns base64 PNG image + scene description
- Files changed: src/app/api/generate/route.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - gpt-image-1 supports b64_json response format directly
  - Split base64 data URL to extract raw base64 for OpenAI vision API
  - getComplexityPrompt duplicates logic from age-selector — could extract to shared util if needed
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-004
- Added Generate button, Skeleton loading state, error display, and result image display to page.tsx
- Generate button disabled when no photo uploaded or during generation
- Error shown in destructive-bordered Card; result shown in Card with img tag
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx (added state management, generate handler, UI sections)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Result image stored as data URL in state — will be needed for US-005 (PNG download) and US-006 (PDF export)
  - All generation state (generating, result, error) lives in page.tsx
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-005
- Added Download PNG button below the generated coloring page image
- Uses shadcn Button with `asChild` wrapping an `<a>` tag with `download` attribute
- Filename: coloring-page.png
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx (added download button in result card)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Result is already a data URL, so `<a href={dataUrl} download="name.png">` works directly — no conversion needed
  - `asChild` on shadcn Button lets you render as an anchor while keeping button styling
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-006
- Added Export PDF button using jsPDF (client-side PDF generation)
- PDF uses letter size, auto-detects landscape/portrait based on image aspect ratio
- Image centered on the page, scaled to fit
- Downloads as "coloring-book.pdf"
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx (added jsPDF import, handleExportPdf callback, Export PDF button)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - jsPDF `addImage` works directly with data URLs — no conversion needed
  - Use `new Image()` to get dimensions for aspect ratio detection before creating PDF
  - jsPDF unit "in" with format "letter" gives 8.5x11 page dimensions
---

## 2026-01-31 - US-007
- Refactored single-result state to array of ColoringPage objects with `selected` boolean
- Button text changes to "Generate Another Variation" after first generation
- Pages displayed in responsive grid (1-col for single, 2-col for multiple)
- Click card to toggle selection; selected pages have ring highlight, deselected are dimmed
- PDF export respects selection — exports selected pages only, or all if none specifically selected
- API route accepts `variationIndex` param, cycles through 6 style variations (faithful, cartoon, storybook, chibi, decorative border, comic book)
- Each page has individual PNG download button
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx (major refactor), src/app/api/generate/route.ts (added variationIndex + styles)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Multi-image PDF: load all images first, then build PDF in onload callback with counter
  - `stopPropagation` on nested buttons inside clickable cards prevents toggle on download click
  - Max width bumped from max-w-xl to max-w-2xl to accommodate 2-column grid
