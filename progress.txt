## Codebase Patterns

- **OpenAI image edit API**: Use `openai.images.edit()` with the `image` parameter (as `Uploadable`) to pass reference images to gpt-image-1. Use `toFile()` from the openai SDK to convert a Buffer to an Uploadable. This preserves composition better than text-only prompts.
- **Base64 to Uploadable**: `const buf = Buffer.from(base64Data, "base64"); const file = await toFile(buf, "photo.jpg", { type: "image/jpeg" });`

- Switched from `openai.images.generate()` to `openai.images.edit()` to pass the original uploaded photo as a reference image to gpt-image-1
- GPT-4o vision description is kept as supplementary context in the prompt
- Updated prompt to emphasize preserving composition, poses, and key details from the original photo
- Files changed: `src/app/api/generate/route.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The OpenAI `images.edit` endpoint accepts an `image` parameter (Uploadable or array) for reference images with gpt-image-1
  - Use `toFile()` from the `openai` package to convert a Buffer into an Uploadable
  - The `images.edit` endpoint supports the same `quality` and `size` params as `images.generate`
  - Cannot verify actual generation output without a real API key; verified build, lint, and UI flow pass

- Fixed remove-image button positioning: moved Button outside CardContent to be a direct child of Card with `relative overflow-hidden py-0`
- Removed padding from CardContent (`p-0`) so the image fills the card edge-to-edge
- Button now sits flush at top-right corner of the preview card
- Files changed: `src/components/photo-upload.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - shadcn Card has `py-6` and CardContent has `px-6` by default — override with `py-0` and `p-0` when you need edge-to-edge content
  - For absolute-positioned elements in cards, position them on the Card itself (with `relative`), not inside CardContent
